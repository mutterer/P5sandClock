# P5 Sand Clock:

I just slightly modified the excellent example script from: "Nature of Code: 5.18 Introduction to matter.js"

* A smaller ball is released for every new displayed frame.
* A larger ball is released about every second.
* Larger balls have some randomness in their size, so that in the end, time appears flow at varying rate.
